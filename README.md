# Semester Project for Team L
# Food4Help


## How to run the project:
The project was made to run the Backend API and Frontend separately as to allow other developers to have access to our API should they also want to utilize our service.

Because of this we have other steps to create our application

First to compile and run the backend/API:
1. cd into the demo folder of the project
2. Run the maven command "clean install". This will generate a "Target" Folder.
3. cd into the created target folder
4. run the generated .jar file
5. done :)
***
Now to run our created user interface:
1. cd into the "appFrontend"
2. run the yarn install command
3. run the yarn start command
4. open localhost:3000
5. done :)
